            <h1>About our country</h1>
            <br>
            <p>The Republic of Lunara, known proudly as the Land of Peace, Progress, and Purity, is a radiant symbol of
                unity, wisdom, and sustainable growth. Rising from ancient traditions yet driven by modern vision,
                Lunara stands as a bridge between the natural world and technological advancement. Every element of its
                culture, architecture, and governance reflects the nation’s deep respect for harmony, balance, and
                enlightenment.

                Geographically diverse and breathtakingly beautiful, Lunara is home to sweeping mountain ranges,
                crystal-clear oceans, golden deserts, and emerald forests that stretch beyond the horizon. Each region
                contributes to the nation’s rich identity — from the coastal artistry of Maris Bay to the agricultural
                heartlands of Velora Plains and the glittering skylines of Solara City, its capital.

                Lunara’s emblem, a crescent moon encircling a ringed planet with seven stars, embodies the unity of its
                seven provinces and the eternal pursuit of peace and progress. The colors of its flag — dark teal and
                silver — symbolize the depth of wisdom and the purity of purpose guiding its people.

                The government of Lunara operates as a democratic republic, where equality, education, and innovation
                form the foundation of national prosperity. The citizens, known as Lunarans, cherish their freedom while
                actively participating in environmental preservation and scientific discovery. Renewable energy,
                interstellar research, and artistic expression thrive side by side, creating a society admired across
                worlds.

                The Republic’s philosophy emphasizes that peace is strength, progress is duty, and purity is virtue.
                Through diplomacy and compassion, Lunara has become a center for cultural exchange, scientific
                collaboration, and humanitarian initiatives across the known galaxies.

                Today, the Republic of Lunara stands not merely as a nation, but as a living example of what humanity —
                and all civilizations — can achieve when guided by unity, purpose, and the light of shared progress</p>

    <h2> Government & Political Structure of the Republic of Lunara</h2>
    <p>
      The Republic of Lunara upholds a <strong>progressive democratic framework</strong> rooted in equality, wisdom, and civic responsibility. Governed under the <em>Lunaran Constitution of Harmony</em>, the nation’s political system ensures that every citizen’s voice contributes to the balance between progress and peace.
    </p>

    <h3>The Tri-Council System</h3>
    <p>
      At the core of Lunara’s governance stands the <strong>Tri-Council System</strong>, representing the unity of its seven provinces:
    </p>

    <ul class="councils">
      <li><strong>The Council of Vision</strong> – Responsible for national development, education, and innovation. It envisions future advancements in science, technology, and sustainability.</li>
      <li><strong>The Council of Balance</strong> – Oversees environmental protection, cultural preservation, and social welfare, ensuring Lunara’s growth remains in harmony with nature.</li>
      <li><strong>The Council of Order</strong> – Handles defense, diplomacy, and interstellar relations, upholding the Republic’s peacekeeping values across allied worlds.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Each council is led by elected representatives from the seven provinces, who serve five-year terms. Above them presides the <strong>Prime Chancellor</strong>, the nation’s chief executive, chosen by a <em>popular vote of the Lunarans</em>. The <strong>High Assembly of Citizens</strong>, the legislative body, reviews and approves national policies, maintaining transparency and inclusivity in governance.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <strong>Judicial Council</strong>, independent from political influence, interprets the Constitution and safeguards civil liberties through the <em>Laws of Purity and Progress</em>, which emphasize justice, education, and equality.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lunara’s <strong>foreign policy</strong> is built on the principles of <em>peaceful diplomacy, knowledge exchange, and cooperative innovation</em>. Through alliances with neighboring star nations, the Republic leads humanitarian missions, renewable energy programs, and interstellar research initiatives.
